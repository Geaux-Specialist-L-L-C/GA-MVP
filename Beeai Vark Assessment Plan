## Geaux Academy VARK Assessment to Curriculum Generation: BeeAI Integration Roadmap

### Objective

Migrate the multi-agent VARK learning style assessment pipeline originally designed with CrewAI to the BeeAI orchestration framework. This pipeline:

* Assesses a student’s preferred learning modalities (Visual, Auditory, Read/Write, Kinesthetic)
* Stores results in their Firebase profile
* Acts as the foundation for future curriculum personalization

### Phase 1: BeeAI Orchestration Setup

#### 1. Define Agent Roles in BeeAI (using Python or TypeScript)

* **ScenarioGeneratorAgent** – Generates questions targeting specific modalities
* **ResponseEvaluatorAgent** – Scores student responses and maps to VARK dimensions
* **ConsistencyCheckerAgent** – Implements adaptive branching logic
* **PreferenceSynthesizerAgent** – Aggregates final results into a friendly report and summary JSON
* **(Optional) TTSAgent / STTAgent** – Voice interface agents wrapping Google Cloud APIs

> Each agent must expose an `execute()` method, operate statelessly, and accept a shared memory object.

#### 2. Define Shared Memory

BeeAI enables multiple agents to share state using memory bindings:

```json
{
  "question_history": [],
  "response_scores": [],
  "session_status": "active",
  "focus_modality": null,
  "final_report": null
}
```

Use memory schemas to track cumulative scores, branching logic signals, and session metadata.

#### 3. Design Workflow (YAML or Python)

Use BeeAI’s declarative YAML to define the orchestration logic:

```yaml
steps:
  - call: ScenarioGeneratorAgent
  - call: ResponseEvaluatorAgent
  - call: ConsistencyCheckerAgent
  - if: session_status != "complete"
    then:
      - loop: back to ScenarioGeneratorAgent
  - call: PreferenceSynthesizerAgent
```

This replicates the adaptive loop used in CrewAI.

#### 4. Register Workflow and Agents

* Configure BeeAI with agent registries
* Enable runtime workflow execution with REST hooks or queue listeners

### Phase 2: Firebase Integration

#### 1. Student Profile Schema

Extend your Firebase user profile structure:

```json
"vark_profile": {
  "visual": 2,
  "auditory": 1,
  "read_write": 0,
  "kinesthetic": 3,
  "summary": "You enjoy learning by doing and seeing things!",
  "timestamp": "..."
}
```

#### 2. Store Result in Firebase

After the PreferenceSynthesizerAgent finishes:

* Write `final_report` into the student document in Firestore
* Trigger a secondary event for curriculum generation pipeline if needed

### Phase 3: API Gateway and Session Handling

#### 1. Assessment Start

```http
POST /api/assessment/vark/start
Response: {
  "session_id": "...",
  "question": { ... }
}
```

* Initializes BeeAI workflow
* Stores session state (can use Redis or Firestore)

#### 2. Assessment Progress

```http
POST /api/assessment/vark/respond
Payload: {
  "session_id": "...",
  "answer": "I want to do a science experiment."
}
Response: {
  "next_question": { ... } | "final_report": { ... }
}
```

* Sends response into workflow
* Advances BeeAI memory state
* Returns either the next question or final summary

### Phase 4: Speech & Safety Layers

#### 1. TTS and STT Agents

* Wrap Google Cloud Text-to-Speech and Speech-to-Text as BeeAI tools
* Expose as callable agents for multimodal sessions

#### 2. Moderation Agent

* Integrate content safety filtering after ScenarioGeneratorAgent and PreferenceSynthesizerAgent
* Apply rules before rendering outputs to children

### Phase 5: Testing and Analytics

* Unit test each agent with mock inputs/outputs
* Use BeeAI’s OpenTelemetry or built-in tracing to log every step
* Implement dashboards for admin/teacher review of:

  * Questions asked
  * Student responses
  * Confidence scores

### Phase 6: Curriculum Trigger

After final result is stored in Firebase:

* Emit an event (e.g., Pub/Sub or Firestore trigger)
* Launch the Curriculum Planning Workflow

  * Input: Grade level + VARK profile
  * Output: Personalized weekly curriculum JSON, saved back to Firebase

This roadmap adapts the CrewAI pipeline into BeeAI’s declarative, modular orchestration model and ensures tight integration with Firebase, allowing Geaux Academy to personalize learning experiences from the moment a student account is created.
