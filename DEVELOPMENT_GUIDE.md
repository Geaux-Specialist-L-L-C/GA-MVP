```

### Coding Standards
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow ESLint configuration
- Write unit tests for critical components
- Document complex functions and components

### Git Workflow
1. Create feature branch from `develop`
2. Follow conventional commits
3. Submit PR with description
4. Require review approval
5. Squash merge to `develop`

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for utilities and hooks
- Integration tests for major features
- E2E tests for critical user flows
- Regular security testing

### Performance Targets
- First Contentful Paint < 1.5s
- Time to Interactive < 3s
- Lighthouse score > 90
- API response time < 200ms
