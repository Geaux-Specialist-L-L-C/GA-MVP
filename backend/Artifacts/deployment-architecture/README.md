# Deployment & System Architecture

## Overview
The Deployment and System Architecture module manages the infrastructure, deployment processes, and overall system design of the Geaux Academy platform.

## Core Components

### 1. Deployment Management
- **deployment-config.tsx**: Deployment configuration interface
- **deployment-dashboard.tsx**: Deployment monitoring and control
- **model-deployment.txt**: AI model deployment system

### 2. System Architecture
- **system-architecture-viz.tsx**: Architecture visualization
- **model-version-control.txt**: Model versioning system

## Key Features
- Automated deployment pipelines
- Infrastructure as Code
- System health monitoring
- Architecture visualization
- Version control management
- Rollback capabilities
- Load balancing

## Technologies
- Docker containers
- Kubernetes orchestration
- CI/CD pipelines
- Cloud infrastructure
- Monitoring tools
- Version control systems

## Architecture Components
1. Frontend Layer
   - React application
   - Static assets
   - Client-side caching

2. Backend Services
   - API servers
   - Authentication service
   - AI model servers
   - WebSocket service

3. Data Layer
   - Databases
   - Cache systems
   - File storage

## Deployment Process
```typescript
interface DeploymentConfig {
  environment: 'development' | 'staging' | 'production';
  services: {
    name: string;
    version: string;
    replicas: number;
    resources: {
      cpu: string;
      memory: string;
    };
  }[];
  monitoring: {
    enabled: boolean;
    metrics: string[];
    alerts: AlertConfig[];
  };
}
```

## Best Practices
1. Infrastructure as Code
2. Automated testing
3. Blue-green deployments
4. Regular backups
5. Security scanning
6. Performance monitoring
7. Documentation updates
8. Disaster recovery planning
