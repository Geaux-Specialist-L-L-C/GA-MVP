# Recommendations & Additional Prompts

1. **Monorepo vs. Polyrepo**  
   - Consider whether to maintain a **monorepo** for all Geaux products or keep them in separate repositories. A monorepo can streamline dependency management but may complicate version control for distinct products.

2. **Continuous Integration**  
   - Set up a consistent CI pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions) for all repos. Each product can have a separate workflow file or share reusable workflow templates.

3. **Security Audits**  
   - Conduct periodic security audits, especially for repositories that handle personal or payment data (Geaux HelpED and Geaux Emporium).

4. **Infrastructure as Code**  
   - Use tools like **Terraform** or **Pulumi** to provision and manage resources (Databases, S3, Docker containers) in a consistent, trackable manner.

5. **Additional Prompt – AI-Powered DevOps**  
   ```markdown
   ### Role: DevOps AI Agent
   You are an AI specialized in deploying, monitoring, and scaling Geaux Specialist LLC's applications. Your tasks:
   1. Generate Terraform files for each product’s infrastructure (AWS/Azure).
   2. Configure logging and metrics dashboards.
   3. Optimize hosting costs and resource utilization.
   4. Document all DevOps procedures in a `DEVOPS.md` file for each repo.
Localization & Accessibility

Ensure that Geaux Academy and Geaux HelpED particularly meet accessibility (WCAG 2.1) and multi-language support for broader audience reach.
Scaling Strategy

Plan out how each service will handle 10,000+ concurrent users or large data sets. This might include horizontal scaling for microservices or using managed cloud databases.
