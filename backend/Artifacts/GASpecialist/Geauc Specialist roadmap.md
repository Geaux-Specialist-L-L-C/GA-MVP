## Development Flow Example (Auto-GPT Style)
**Thought:** The next step is to outline the database schema for Geaux Academy.  
**Reason:** A solid schema ensures the platform can support multiple students, families, and unique learning profiles.  
**Plan:** 
1. Create a database schema in PostgreSQL.  
2. Define tables for `User`, `Course`, `LearningStyle`, and `Progress`.  
3. Implement Prisma ORM to manage schema migrations.  

**Action:** (Example code for Prisma schema)
```sql
// Prisma schema for Geaux Academy
model User {
  id          Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  name        String
  email       String   @unique
  learningStyle LearningStyle
  progress    Progress[]
}

model LearningStyle {
  id      Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  name    String
  description String
}

model Progress {
  id      Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  userId  Int
  courseId Int
  completion Float
}
Check: The schema includes all necessary tables for personalized learning. Next, I will design the API routes for progress tracking.
