# Learning Assessment & AI Evaluation

## Overview
The Learning Assessment module is responsible for evaluating student learning styles, progress, and educational achievements through AI-powered assessment tools.

## Core Components

### 1. Assessment Engines
- **learning-assessment-algorithms.py**: Core assessment logic
- **learning-style-assessment.py**: VARK model implementation
- **subject-specific-tests.py**: Subject-based evaluation tools
- **style-specific-tests.py**: Learning style-specific assessments

### 2. Scoring & Evaluation
- **assessment-scoring.py**: Scoring logic and metrics
- **advanced-evaluation.py**: Complex evaluation patterns
- **subject-scoring-rubrics.py**: Subject-specific scoring criteria
- **expanded-skill-rubrics.py**: Comprehensive skill evaluation

### 3. Learning Flow
- **learning-style-flow.py**: Learning style progression tracking

## Data Models
```typescript
interface AssessmentResult {
  studentId: string;
  learningStyle: {
    visual: number;
    auditory: number;
    reading: number;
    kinesthetic: number;
  };
  subjectScores: {
    [subject: string]: number;
  };
  recommendedApproach: string[];
  timestamp: Date;
}
```

## Best Practices
1. Regular calibration of assessment algorithms
2. Maintain assessment security
3. Ensure accessibility compliance
4. Implement progressive difficulty
5. Regular validation of results
6. Store detailed assessment metadata
